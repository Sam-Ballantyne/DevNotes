## Advantages of Cloud vs Traditional Data Centres

* No high capital cost for developing data centre infrastructure
* Simply pay for what you use
* Do not have to try and predict future usage, instead can scale on demand
* Agility increased as it costs less to try new processes /ideas
* Reduced security and reliability risk as the infrastructure is managed for you

## Deployment Models

* __Public Cloud:__ Using a public cloud provider (like AWS)
* __Private (on-premises) Cloud:__ Using a private data centre
* __Hybird Cloud:__ A mix of public and private cloud

## Definitions

* __IaaS:__ Infrastructure as a service, hosting, running and maintaining virtual machines or servers in the cloud
