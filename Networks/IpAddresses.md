## Overview

* Binary, hexidecimal and decimal are just different notation for representing numbers
* Most of the time we use decimal which is also called Base10 (given the 10 different symbols that make up the digits)
* But we also have binary which is Base2 (only using 0s and 1s)
* And hexadecimal which is Base15 (using numbers 0 to 9 then letters A to F)
